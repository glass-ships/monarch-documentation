## Monarch role: Ontology lead

The Monarch Ontology lead is responsible for coordinating all Monarch-related ontology efforts. 
Primarily means the following:

1. Drive Monarch Ontologies towards a common development stack:
   1. ODK for releases and QC
   1. Shared Python libraries for code in favour of scripts
   1. DOSDP and ROBOT templates for pattern driven development
1. Establish documentation standards (minimal requirements for ontology documentation based on Monarch-wide SOPs)
1. Coordinate reporting responsibilities:
   1. Ontology related RPPR reports
   1. Ontology Working Group report presentations (get people to provide content)
