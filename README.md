# Monarch Technical Documentation
Technical documentation for all Monarch applications, packages, services and related projects.

# Overview
The Monarch initiative knowledge graph (Monarch KG) is created using a constellation of tools and packages created by the Monarch Initiative team and out collaboratores. The purpose of this repository is to document the connections between the Monarch Intiative tools and how they are used to create the Monarch Graph. The intent of this repository is to serve as the source of truth for documentation of the project overall. This is accomplished by connecting to each repository and the documentation therein as the source of truth for that repository. Documentation for how the different software tools are used together will be documented in this higher-level repository.

# Organization
